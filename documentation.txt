Helloooo, Andrei here
im gonna show you how to use pythonFs (pyFs/pfs)

lesson 1!
creating a file :D
    file creation works by first adding a file name to the "fs" array
    then, it also adds the contents of the file
    this is done using numpy

    now, onto actually adding the file
    you can do this by first importing pyfs using:
    import pyfs as pfs

    then, you can add a file using the addFile function:
    pfs.addFile(filename, file contents)

lesson 2!
reading a file >:D
    reading a file works using a while loop
    the while loop checks every element inside of the "fs" array
    when the name of the file is found, it returns the next piece of data in the array

    you can read a file using this:
    var = pfs.readFile(filename)

lesson 3!
deleting a file D:
    deleting a file works simillarly to reading it
    a while loop checks the array, finds a name, and deletes the name along with the next piece of data

    you can delete a file using this:
    pfs.delFile(filename);

dependencies needed are: numpy, python
